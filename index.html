          <h2>15 Secrets the Airlines Don't Want You to Know</h2>
          <h3>Say no to vouchers -- you're entitled to cold, hard cash</h3>

        <section class="grid_6 sub">
          <p> If you’re involuntarily bumped from a flight because it's overbooked, DO NOT settle for vouchers; they're the airline equivalent of Geoffrey Dollars. Airlines offer them frequently (like every time, let’s be real) but they are required to tell you that you can get a check on the spot. It's like your flight-delay Miranda rights.</p>

          <h2>You can cancel within 24 hours of booking for no charge</h2>
          <p> Now, there are caveats, so don't go booking out an entire planeful of tickets just for shits and giggles. First, with most airlines, you can cancel/change your ticket up to seven days before you’re scheduled to travel and still get a full refund. (The notable exception is American Airlines, which instead allows you to hold a ticket up to 24 hours at the price you see.)</p>
